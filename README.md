Type-safe linear algebra library
================================

- General matrix types are implemented in native Haskell.

- The dimensions of matrices are statically typed.

- Provides bindings to high performance C++ linear algebra libraries such Eigen and Spectra.

Following GHC extensions may be needed:

- ScopedTypeVariables
- RankNTypes
- TypeFamilies
- DataKinds
